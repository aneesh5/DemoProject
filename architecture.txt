Singleton Design Pattern:

The project is build in Singleton design pattern because Singleton design pattern is a creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. 
It is one of the simplest design patterns but is important in scenarios where exactly one instance of a class is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

I've incorporated essential dependencies, such as Lombok for code simplification, Jackson for efficient JSON processing, and Spring WebMVC to enhance the project's user interface, making it more fluid and interactive
